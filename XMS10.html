  <h3>Looks:</h3>
  <p>XMS10 imitates a human, taking the form of a white male that is 14 years of age.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Behavior:</h3>
  <p>XMS10 acts similarly to other humans, blending in easily. It acts positive, smiling for most of its conversations with other humans. It rarely expresses feelings of anger.</p>
  <h3>If upset:</h3>
  <p>If upset at a human, XMS10 says one of two responses.</p>
  <p>1. "Let's just not." - Response kindly telling the collocutor to stop whatever it is they're doing.
  2. "Can we not?" - A more irritated response asking the collocutor to stop.</p>
  <p>However, if extremely agitated, it lightly slaps the person it is annoyed at. If the person is wearing shoelaces, XMS10 will untie them.</p>
